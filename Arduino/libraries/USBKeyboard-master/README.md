# USBKeyboard
## Introduction
USBKeyboard is a library for the Arduino IDE. It adds HID USB keyboard functionality to your projects, allowing Arduinos and other AVRs to act as a HID USB Devices.  
Due to its HID protocol no drivers have to be installed, the USB keyboard connection will work with every PC and OS.

## Getting Started
Connect your Arduino to the USB connector following the given schematic below and add a pushbutton betwen D7 and GND. Copy this repository into your `libraries` folder and (re)start the Arduino IDE.  
Open `File > Examples > USBKeyboard > USBKeyboard_GettingStarted` and upload it to your Arduino.  
Unplug your Arduino from your PC and plug in the USB connector. The keyboard should be recognized automatically by your PC, open a text editor of your choice and push the button afterwards, a message will be typed in.

## Schematic

You just need the zener diodes if your Arduino/AVR is running above 3.6V  
(following the USB specification 3.6V is the maximum for D+ and D-).

## Reference
This library is based on the [V-USB code](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/) by Objective Developement.
